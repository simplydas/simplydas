<h1>Hi there 👋 I am Simply</h1>
<h3> Welcome to my GitHub profile!</h3>
</div>

I’m an ex-architect turned UI/UX designer and web developer with a keen eye for aesthetics and functionality.

With 4 years of experience in architecture, I’ve spent years shaping physical spaces, learning the art of balancing form, function, and user needs. Today, I channel that same design philosophy into creating intuitive digital experiences and beautiful, responsive websites.

Beyond the screen, you’ll find me exploring new places, capturing stories through my lens, and constantly seeking inspiration from the world around me. Travel and photography fuel my creativity and give me fresh perspectives that reflect in my work.
